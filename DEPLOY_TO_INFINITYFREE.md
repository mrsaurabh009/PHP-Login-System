## üéØ Step-by-Step Deployment Process

### Step 1: Access Your InfinityFree Control Panel

1. Go to https://dash.infinityfree.net/ and login
2. Find your account: **saurabh-php-auth.infinityfreeapp.com**
3. Click on the account to access the control panel

### Step 2: Upload Your Project Files

**Option A: Using File Manager (Recommended)**
1. In your control panel, click **"File Manager"**
2. Navigate to the **`htdocs`** folder
3. Delete the default files: `index2.html` and any other default files
4. Upload all your project files:
   - `index.php`
   - `login.php`
   - `register.php`
   - `dashboard.php`
   - `logout.php`
   - `config.php`
   - `styles.css`
   - `database.sql`
   - All other project files

**Option B: Using FTP Client**
1. Download an FTP client like FileZilla
2. Use FTP details from your control panel
3. Connect and upload files to `/htdocs/` directory

### Step 3: Create MySQL Database

1. In your InfinityFree control panel, go to **"MySQL Databases"**
2. Click **"Create Database"**
3. Choose a database name (e.g., `userauth` or `login_system`)
4. **IMPORTANT**: Note down these details that will be generated:
   - Database Host: `sqlXXX.infinityfree.com`
   - Database Name: `if0_XXXXXXX_yourdbname`
   - Database Username: `if0_XXXXXXX`
   - Database Password: `[generated password]`

### Step 4: Import Database Schema

1. In your control panel, click **"phpMyAdmin"**
2. Login with your database credentials (from Step 3)
3. Select your database from the left sidebar
4. Click **"Import"** tab
5. Choose your `database.sql` file and click **"Go"**
6. Verify the `users` table was created successfully

### Step 5: Update Configuration File

1. Open your `config.php` file (either via File Manager or download/edit/reupload)
2. Update the database settings with the details from Step 3:

```php
<?php
// Database configuration - Updated for InfinityFree
define('DB_HOST', 'sqlXXX.infinityfree.com');        // Your actual MySQL host
define('DB_NAME', 'if0_XXXXXXX_yourdbname');         // Your actual database name  
define('DB_USER', 'if0_XXXXXXX');                    // Your actual database username
define('DB_PASS', 'your_generated_password');        // Your actual database password
```

3. Save the file and upload it back to `/htdocs/` if edited locally

### Step 6: Test Your Live Application

1. Visit: **https://saurabh-php-auth.infinityfreeapp.com**
2. You should see your homepage with the authentication system
3. Test the following functionality:
   - ‚úÖ Homepage loads correctly
   - ‚úÖ Registration form works
   - ‚úÖ Login system functions
   - ‚úÖ Dashboard accessible after login
   - ‚úÖ Logout works properly

### Step 7: Troubleshooting Common Issues

**If you see database connection errors:**
1. Double-check database credentials in `config.php`
2. Ensure database was created and imported correctly
3. Verify MySQL host address is correct

**If pages show errors:**
1. Check that all files were uploaded correctly
2. Ensure file permissions are set properly
3. Check PHP error logs in control panel

**If styles don't load:**
1. Verify `styles.css` was uploaded to the root directory
2. Check file paths in HTML files
